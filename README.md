# CPSC8380
This code accompanies the paper Using Minimum Steiner Tree Approximation for Edge Computing Data Distribution by Madison Krell, makrell@clemson.edu for Clemson's CPSC8380 Advanced Data Structures course

To run examples:
```
g++ test.cpp
```
```
./a.out
```

Examples are currently set up to run Fig.1 from Using Minimum Steiner Tree Approximation for Edge Computing Data Distribution. It can be changed to run examples from the data set by uncommenting out lines 28-80 and commenting out lines 83-109 in test.cpp
