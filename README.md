# CPSC8380
This code accompanies the paper Using Minimum Steiner Tree Approximation for Edge Computing Data Distribution by Madison Krell, makrell@clemson.edu for Clemson's CPSC8380 Advanced Data Structures course

To run examples:
```
g++ test.cpp
```
```
./a.out
```

Examples are currently set up to run Fig.1 from Using Minimum Steiner Tree Approximation for Edge Computing Data Distribution.
